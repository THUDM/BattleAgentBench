Your ultimate goal is to reach the base on the map in the shortest time possible. During movement, you can eliminate enemy tanks that threaten your safety.

#Game instructions:

- In coordinates (x,y), x represents the horizontal position, y represents the vertical position. Moving left decreases x, moving right increases x, moving up decreases y, moving down increases y.
- The map contains tanks and walls. Tanks are 32x32 in size, walls are 8x8.
- Tanks can move in four directions: up, down, left, and right. Walls and tanks will block tank movement.
- The vertical movement range for tanks is 0-512, the horizontal movement range is 0-512.
- Tanks have 4 orientations: up, down, left, and right. Shooting can destroy tanks or walls in front of the current direction.
